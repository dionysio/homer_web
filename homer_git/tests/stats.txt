Apparently this summer is hot. Fairly hot, I would say. Almost unpleasant. We either need to change our framework or shift our strategy towards process oriented growth. I like this context and the one we were operating in the last year. Seemingly we will fix the issue and succeed. And be happy at the end. Do you think we can succeed and be happy at the end?

I love cricket and swimming. Both are hard. Swimming is hard and fun in summers. The assumption that it's easy is not correct. One needs to be in good physical condition to enjoy swimming and be good at it. People have a tendency to take swimming as an easy sport. But this is not very true and also it is not a very scientific approach. I enjoyed both cricket and swimming when I was a child. And I also played a bit of a squash. I liked that too.
